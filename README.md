# Scrutinising Motion Comparing Contemporary and Traditional Approaches to Optical Flow Estimation

Thoroughly examined motion and compared the performance of the contemporary and traditional optical flow estimation methods with the help of multiple GPUs and CPUs, parameter tuning and diverse real-world scenarios. Conducted statistical analysis tests such as confidence interval and independent t-tests over 30 videos to show which method is better, thus contributing to Computer Vision and Machine Learning research.

Highlights: 

⁃ Worked on SwiFlowNet, a 83 layer deep learning neural network based on a multi flow model that estimates the optical flow with GPU's assistance for computing and Tensorflow as the leading end-to-end machine learning platform. The traditional approach used the Farneback algorithm of optical flow estimation, the CPU for computing, and Open CV as the main library.

⁃ Evaluated Performance on the the NVIDIA A100, TESLA V100 and NVIDIA RTX 3090 Ti for the machine learning model computation. Intel core i9, Intel core i7, and M2 were the CPUs under the Linux, Windows and MAC operating systems for performance evaluation.

⁃ Performed statistical tests such as confidence interval and independent t-tests over a sample of 30 Videos shot through the Intel Real Sense D435i and the iPhone 11 to get confidence, difference and clarity.

⁃ Analysed the parameters such as error metrics, execution Time, memory usage, temperature, the performance of activation functions, the performance of Cameras, 95 % confidence test and independent t-test visually through data visualisation tools such as Tableau.
